//! Content provider abstraction for publishing.
//!
//! The [`ContentProvider`] trait decouples the publishing pipeline from its
//! content source. Implementations can read from the local filesystem, from
//! CRDT state, or from any other storage backend.
//!
//! Two implementations:
//! - `FilesystemContentProvider` (in this module's sibling `fs_content_provider`) — reads local files
//! - `CrdtContentProvider` (in `diaryx_sync`, feature "server") — reads CRDT state
